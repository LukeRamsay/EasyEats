# EasyEats

A Basic Recipe app for Android 303 At Open Window

# Introduction
This project was done for Android 303

We were tasked with creating a basic recipe app in Android Studio using Kotlin

We were require to do the following:
1. The application should allow users to select a category for the recipes/project that
they want to answer.
2. The application should allow the user to add their own recipes/projects.
3. The application should allow the user view other recipes/projects that users have
posted.
4. You will use Firebase Firestore as you backend for the application.
5. You must implement Git Version control and also use GitHub or GitLab as your remote
repository.
